/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for FarsiFanConnect.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data stored under their unique user ID.
 * @dataStructure All user data is nested under the `/users/{userId}` collection, providing a clear ownership hierarchy.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *   - The rules explicitly deny all write access by default and grant it only after ownership validation.
 *   - The `id` field within each user document must match the `userId` in the path to prevent unauthorized data access.
 * @denormalization For authorization purposes, the user ID is embedded in the document path (`/users/{userId}`) and must match the `id` field within the document. This avoids the need for complex queries or additional reads during authorization checks.
